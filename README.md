# Code Institute

Welcome USER_NAME,

We have preinstalled all of the tools you need to get started.

To run a frontend application in GitPod, in the terminal, type:

`python3 -m http.server`

A blue button should appear to click: *Expose*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

To run a backend python file, type `python3 app.py`, if your python file is named `app.py` of course.

A blue button should appear to click: *Expose*,

Another blue button should appear to click: *Open Browser*.

In Gitpod you have superuser security privileges by default. Therefore you do not need to use the `sudo` (superuser do) command in the bash terminal in any of the backend lessons. 

Happy coding!
